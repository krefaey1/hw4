Create a simple webpage containing this graphic and host it on github pages. -Do not- host this off of your assignment repo from github classroom, since this is not public. Instead, you'll have to create a new public repo from your regular github account and add this file. Put the link to your live web page in a markdown cell of your hw4.ipynb file. Note, an easy way to create a webpage with this graphic is to export an ipynb as an html file.
